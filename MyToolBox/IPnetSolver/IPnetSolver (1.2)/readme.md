# IPnetSolver Version 1.2
IPnetSolver is a command-line tool designed to simplify subnetting tasks and enhance networking efficiency. Originally named "Automated Subnetting Tool," IPnetSolver provides an intuitive way to calculate subnets, understand IP ranges, convert IP addresses and whole numbers into binary, and divide networks, making it a valuable resource for students, network engineers, and penetration testers.

## Features
- **Fixed-Length Subnet Masking**: All subnets are of equal size, meaning each subnet has the same number of hosts. This method is simple and easy to manage but may lead to IP address wastage.
- **Variable-Length Subnet Masking**: Subnets can vary in size, allowing for more efficient IP address allocation based on specific needs. This method is more complex but reduces IP address wastage.
- **Supernetting**: A technique used to combine multiple subnets into a single larger network, often to reduce routing complexity.
- **IP Adderesses/Whole Numbers to Binary Converter**:  Converts an IP address into its binary equivalent, helping in understanding the underlying network structure.

## What's New in Version 1.2
- **Optimized Overall Code**: Enhanced the efficiency and performance of the entire codebase for better functionality.
- **Added get_info() Function in Supernetting**: Introduced a new get_info() function within the supernetting feature to retrieve and display detailed information about the supernetting result.
- **Added Helper Function File**: Introduced a separate file for helper functions to improve code organization and reusability.
- **Added Type Hints**: Incorporated type hints throughout the code to improve readability and maintainability.
- **Minor Tweaks to Features**: Made small adjustments to features, improving the accuracy of the usable IP range results.
