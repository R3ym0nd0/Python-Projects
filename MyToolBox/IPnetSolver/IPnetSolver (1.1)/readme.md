# IPnetSolver Version 1.1
### IPnetSolver is a command-line tool designed to simplify subnetting tasks and enhance networking efficiency. Originally named "Automated Subnetting Tool," IPnetSolver provides an intuitive way to calculate subnets, understand IP ranges, and divide networks, making it a valuable resource for students, network engineers, and penetration testers.

## Features
- **Fixed-Length Subnet Masking**: All subnets are of equal size, meaning each subnet has the same number of hosts. This method is simple and easy to manage but may lead to IP address wastage.
- **Variable-Length Subnet Masking**: Subnets can vary in size, allowing for more efficient IP address allocation based on specific needs. This method is more complex but reduces IP address wastage.
- **Supernetting**: A technique used to combine multiple subnets into a single larger network, often to reduce routing complexity.
- **IP Adderesses/Numbers to Binary**:  Converts an IP address into its binary equivalent, helping in understanding the underlying network structure.

*Note: Sorry for the boring design; I'm still working on this! Your feedback is welcome as I continue to improve the tool.*
