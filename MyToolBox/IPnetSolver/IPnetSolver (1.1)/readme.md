# IPnetSolver Version 1.1
IPnetSolver is a command-line tool designed to simplify subnetting tasks and enhance networking efficiency. Originally named "Automated Subnetting Tool," IPnetSolver provides an intuitive way to calculate subnets, understand IP ranges, convert IP addresses and whole numbers into binary, and divide networks, making it a valuable resource for students, network engineers, and penetration testers.

## Features
- **Fixed-Length Subnet Masking**: All subnets are of equal size, meaning each subnet has the same number of hosts. This method is simple and easy to manage but may lead to IP address wastage.
- **Variable-Length Subnet Masking**: Subnets can vary in size, allowing for more efficient IP address allocation based on specific needs. This method is more complex but reduces IP address wastage.
- **Supernetting**: A technique used to combine multiple subnets into a single larger network, often to reduce routing complexity.
- **IP Adderesses/Whole Numbers to Binary Converter**:  Converts an IP address into its binary equivalent, helping in understanding the underlying network structure.

## What's New
- **Updated Tool Name**: Renamed from "Automated Subnetting Tool" to "IPnetSolver" for a more unique and recognizable title.
- **Enhanced Documentation**: Added comments throughout the code to improve clarity and understanding.
- **Grammar Corrections**: Refined error messages and prompts for improved readability and professionalism.
- **Streamlined Features**: Removed overly complicated features to keep the tool focused and user-friendly.
- **Improved Output Formatting**: Added separators (==========) to organize output sections and enhance readability.
