# Automated Subnetting Tool
- ### The Automated Subnetting Tool simplifies the process of subnetting, making it easier to calculate subnets for IP addresses. This tool is designed for network engineers and students who want to streamline their subnetting tasks.

## Features
- **Fixed-Length Subnet Masking**: All subnets are of equal size, meaning each subnet has the same number of hosts. This method is simple and easy to manage but may lead to IP address wastage.
- **Variable-Length Subnet Masking**: Subnets can vary in size, allowing for more efficient IP address allocation based on specific needs. This method is more complex but reduces IP address wastage.
- **Supernetting**: A technique used to combine multiple subnets into a single larger network, often to reduce routing complexity.
- **IP Adderesses/Numbers to Binary**:  Converts an IP address into its binary equivalent, helping in understanding the underlying network structure.
